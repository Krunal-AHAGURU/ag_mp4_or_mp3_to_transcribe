00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.280
So, far we have been focusing on questions where all the forces are either horizontal

2
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.000
or they are vertical upward downward right, but many times what happens is that forces

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.640
are obviously are at an angle. So, we need to know what to do in such a case. So, for

4
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.560
example, if I had a block and it has a force that is acting this way. Now, how do I deal

5
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.880
with such a force ok. So, standard approach is to convert everything to a combination

6
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.640
of horizontal and vertical forces. So, we will say that this force is actually so much

7
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.680
horizontal and so much vertical. You can always break up a force that is like this into a

8
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.719
horizontal component and a vertical component. This thing we call i cap. So, this direction

9
00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.320
you know we call it i cap direction. This direction we call it j cap direction. So,

10
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.680
what does that mean? That means if I have 3 units like this i cap is 1 unit. So, if

11
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.480
I have 3 units like this it is i cap plus i cap plus i cap we will write it as 3 i cap.

12
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:24.120
What does that mean? The length is 3 ok i cap has length 1. Now, if in this direction

13
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:33.600
I have a force which is 4 units long I would not say 4 i cap I will say 4 j cap and then

14
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.000
this force which is actually this force plus that force. Now, this plus is not the usual

15
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.159
plus it is not 3 plus 4 it is 3 like this plus 4 like this. So, for example, if I go

16
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:57.439
3 units horizontally and I go 4 units vertically have I gone 7 units? No right I walked 7 units

17
00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.599
but my displacement would actually be this much. Now, how much is this Pythagoras theorem

18
00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:12.280
tells us that a square plus b square is c square. So, this is root of 3 square plus

19
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.080
4 square. Now, that is 9 plus 16 25. So, root of 25 is 5, but this is not length 5 this

20
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.000
is a vector it is in a direction. So, this is not the best way to write it what I will

21
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.039
do is I will say that this vector f usually we will put an arrow on top is just simply

22
00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:43.199
3 i cap plus 4 j cap Newtons if this was in Newtons it is 3 i cap plus 4 j cap Newtons.

23
00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:50.799
This is the answer not this that is not the answer, but magnitude of f you do not want to

24
00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:57.479
know what is the value of f, but you want to know the magnitude of f which means we

25
00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:04.519
only want the length then we can say that is equal to root of 3 square plus 4 square

26
00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:14.000
which is 5, but the force is not this force is 3 i cap plus 4 j cap. Suppose I had a force

27
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.039
which was like this force which I have broken it up like that. So, suppose this was 6 i

28
00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:27.479
cap and this was well now let us think if it was upward I would be calling it j cap.

29
00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:31.840
Now, it is downward. So, I will be calling it minus j cap, but usually we put the minus

30
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:43.680
in front. So, let us say minus 5 j cap what is this force it is just simply 6 i cap minus

31
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.919
5 j cap that is it over. Now, suppose I ask you let us add this force

32
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.920
plus this force is that easy. Suppose this was 2 units 2 Newtons and this was 3 Newtons

33
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:07.560
what is the total force 5 Newtons this is easy. Suppose I had 2 Newtons and I had to

34
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:17.520
add like this 6 Newtons what is the total force 2 minus 6. So, minus 4. So, here we

35
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.519
will say it is minus 4 Newtons why because you see 2 this way and 6 that way this is

36
00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:31.199
going to be my resultant force minus 4 Newtons if I assume this to be the positive direction

37
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:37.599
but it is 4 Newtons in this direction. Now, these are all easy we have already seen what

38
00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:44.639
to do if it is perpendicular. Suppose I ask you what about this force plus some force

39
00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:52.240
like this this force it is not even perpendicular that is the resultant force is this but how

40
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.479
do I add this force and that force tough. But if somebody gave me this force in this

41
00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:08.680
form suppose they say this is 7 Newtons making an angle of something 40 degrees with this

42
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.120
very difficult but instead of doing this suppose they had given it like this they had said

43
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:27.160
I have here a force which is let us say 4 i cap plus 3 j cap another force like this

44
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:36.199
let us say 2 i cap minus 1 j cap ok. So, this is a little longer and that is a little shorter

45
00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:43.920
now what is this force just add these two straight away 4 i cap plus 2 i cap how much

46
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:53.079
is that 6 i cap 3 j cap minus j cap how much is that plus 2 j cap that is it over.

47
00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:58.519
Now suppose you want the length of this you want the length not the force. So, the force

48
00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:08.759
is this but what is the length of this force we will write that just as f without the arrow

49
00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.399
what is the length of this force very simple root of this square plus that square root of

50
00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:20.120
6 square plus 2 square we can calculate it but that is the basic idea why is that the

51
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:29.879
case because 6 i cap plus 2 j cap means this is 6 i cap and that is 2 j cap what is this

52
00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:35.560
length 6 what is that length 2. So, what is this length Pythagoras theorem says root

53
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.280
of 6 square plus 2 square and that is what I have written ok.

54
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.720
So, once you write the force in the form of i and j the question becomes extremely easy

55
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.800
in need usually you get 1 or 2 questions where the question itself is given in i and j form

56
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.640
but then sometimes the question is not given in i and j form. So, then means you need to

57
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.120
convert it into i and j form. So, first let us start looking at what to do if the question

58
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:07.960
is given in i and j form. So, now let us look at questions where we are looking at all objects

59
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.400
only in space after that we will worry about objects on the ground. Now what happens when

60
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.240
you have objects in space you do not have to worry about gravitational force. So, they

61
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.600
are all hanging in space just for easy calculation. Now if I have this 5 kg block in space with

62
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.680
3 forces acting on it what is its acceleration. Now in all questions I am really asking you

63
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680
to find acceleration.

64
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:36.639
So, let us think about it 6 plus 8 how much is that 14 minus 4 so that is 10. So, acceleration

65
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:44.759
is 10 divided by 5 2 meters per second square in that direction correct. Now this we have

66
00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:51.279
done earlier. So, really this is quite easy I will write this now as acceleration is 2

67
00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:58.920
i cap meters per second square. If I write it this way I do not have to say that way

68
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.279
do you understand because this is already i cap. So, that is the reason we introduce

69
00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.279
this question.

70
00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:08.599
Now let us think about the other questions. So, suppose I take this question but in this

71
00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:13.839
question there is one force like this one like this and one like that I want the acceleration

72
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:25.400
but acceleration is a vector and it is net force by mass. What is net force here? Let

73
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:33.960
us see this is 4 i cap plus 6 j cap what about this one 7 i cap it is not given but you know

74
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.120
it is horizontal and it is that way. So, it is 7 i cap what about this one minus 2 i cap

75
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.480
plus 4 j cap how do you find how do you add all this up add all i caps together minus 2

76
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:56.399
i cap plus 4 i cap which is 2 i cap plus 7 i cap which is 9 i cap 4 j cap plus 6 j cap

77
00:08:56.399 --> 00:09:12.840
10 j cap divided by 2 which means the acceleration is 4.5 i cap plus 5 j cap meters per second

78
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840
square.

79
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:21.720
Now 4.5 i cap plus 5 j cap will look like this direction. So, this is the acceleration

80
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.320
direction now is this the magnitude of acceleration or is this the direction plus magnitude of

81
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:33.879
acceleration both right this includes direction it also has everything in it. So, this is

82
00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:39.879
the full acceleration suppose somebody asks us I do not want a but I want magnitude of

83
00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:50.399
a then you say root of 4.5 square plus 5 square every time you do not need to draw the right

84
00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:54.840
angle triangle you can directly say that if it is x i cap plus y j cap it is x square

85
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.399
plus y square root of that that will be the magnitude. So, is that clear? So, if I am

86
00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:04.439
given a force like this it is very easy to add these forces and come up with one single

87
00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:09.639
force therefore, you can find the acceleration is that clear now that is because I have given

88
00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:15.679
the format i and j that is very important if you do not get that format convert it into

89
00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:19.799
that format ok. Sometimes what happens is this is the easier one people look at this

90
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.960
I do not know what to do but I hope that is very clear you know what to do with this now

91
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.000
let us take a slightly more complex question ok. So, I am going to look at this question.

92
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.560
So, if I look at this question then in this question I have a force F how much I do not

93
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:43.520
know but I have another force horizontal direction what should I write this 10 i cap this is

94
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.640
already given as minus 5 i cap minus 5 j cap minus 5 i cap minus 5 j cap that is why

95
00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:54.519
it is pointing in the downward direction like that. Now, if I look at the acceleration

96
00:10:54.519 --> 00:11:02.279
of this 3 kg block that is given do you remember Newton's second law what is it? Net force

97
00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:07.240
is mass into acceleration now this force is some angle I do not know what angle let us

98
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.399
write this as F vector net force is this force plus this force plus this force.

99
00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:25.720
So, if I write it here I will write F plus 10 i cap minus 5 i cap minus 5 j cap this

100
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:35.240
is the total right this must be equal to mass into acceleration. So, 3 times 2 i cap plus

101
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:42.159
3 j cap if you remember earlier I told you first write ma but that was because you were

102
00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:46.919
not using i and j with i and j the direction is already there. So, whether you write this

103
00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:49.079
first or whether you write that first does not matter.

104
00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:56.199
So, if you use vectors it is very straightforward and simple. So, F if I solve this is 6 i cap

105
00:11:56.199 --> 00:12:03.039
that is 10 i cap this is 10 minus 5 how much is this 5 i cap. So, when you bring 5 i cap

106
00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:10.360
here 6 minus 5 1 so, this is going to be 1 i cap this is 9 j cap that is minus 5 j cap

107
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:19.000
so, when it comes here it will become plus 5 9 plus 5 14. So, that means the force unknown

108
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:28.279
force here we found is i cap plus 14 j cap it is a very large force if you want its magnitude

109
00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:36.240
what will it be root of 1 square because it is i cap means 1 i cap plus 14 square. So,

110
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.039
that will be the magnitude of this force ok. So, I hope you know how to find this if acceleration

111
00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:43.120
is given you can find the unknown force.

112
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:49.360
Now, let us look at this case here the actual acceleration was given now let us let me explain

113
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.600
what this question is like. So, you have a 3 k g block you have 1 force minus 5 i cap

114
00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:04.639
plus 3 j cap another force do not know F a third force which is 3 i cap plus 6 j cap

115
00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:13.360
newtons in that direction I have been told that this block this object is moving vertically

116
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:22.120
up no horizontal motion no horizontal acceleration means what net force in the horizontal direction

117
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:35.360
must be 0 ok. So, let us think about it this is only j cap i cap is 0 only j cap ok. So,

118
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.960
for example, this was one of the questions that came up in need one of similar kind of

119
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:45.600
question came up where what is given is you want this force such that it is only going

120
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.480
to go vertically. So, what is what are you going to conclude this i cap plus that i cap

121
00:13:52.480 --> 00:14:00.560
plus this is also i cap ok this plus this plus this must become what 0 because i cap

122
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:07.639
force is 0 ok. So, how much is my net i cap force. So, I will write i cap how much is the

123
00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:17.879
i cap force F plus 3 minus 5 must be 0. So, what does that mean F minus 2 is 0. So, F must

124
00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:25.480
be equal to 2 newtons. So, have I found out what is this force 2 newtons in the i cap

125
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:32.360
direction now suppose they ask you what is this acceleration find this acceleration well

126
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:39.240
this force plus this force plus this force became 0 what is remaining this plus this.

127
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:51.039
So, how much is the net force 9 j cap newtons. So, F net is 9 j cap newtons what happened

128
00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:58.159
to i cap became 0 cancelled out, but if it is 9 j cap net force by mass will be the acceleration

129
00:14:58.159 --> 00:15:09.679
net force is 9 mass is 3. So, net force by mass 3. So, acceleration is F net by mass

130
00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:15.600
and so that is going to give me 9 divided by 3. So, it is going to be 3 j cap units

131
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:23.519
meters per second square understood. So, this way what I have done is that we can find both

132
00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:29.079
the force as well as the acceleration, but notice acceleration was not given in the beginning

133
00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:33.480
what was given is that it is going to be vertical that was that is all that was given. So, is

134
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:38.039
that clear how to apply something like this if the force is given in terms of i and j

135
00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:41.000
you should be able to combine it like this and solve.

136
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.480
Now, what if the force is not given as i and j what do I do well you resolve. So, let us

137
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:55.080
learn how to do that many times we will be given forces that are inclined at some angle

138
00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:04.560
let us say that this was a force F and it makes some angle theta with the horizontal.

139
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:11.920
Now, this is not given in the form of i and j i cap j cap. So, we will convert it how

140
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.880
much i cap this much i cap plus this much j cap, but what is this much how do I know

141
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:26.240
what is this much. So, let us say it was x i cap y j cap, but you know that this length

142
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:37.520
is F this length is x and this length is y. Then y by F what is y by F it is the opposite

143
00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:44.399
side of this right angle triangle by the hypotenuse what is opposite by hypotenuse sin theta.

144
00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:52.279
So, this is sin of this angle opposite by hypotenuse. So, what is y F sin theta. So,

145
00:16:52.279 --> 00:17:05.839
I will write this as F sin theta j cap and then x by F x by F is cos theta. So, that

146
00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:14.000
means x is F cos theta. So, instead of writing it as x i cap I will write it as F cos theta

147
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.439
i cap. In fact, you should do this all the time automatically you look at this force

148
00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:29.480
and then you immediately say what is this component we call this the component F theta

149
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:41.480
F cos theta other side F sin theta always F cos theta is easy F cos theta F sin theta

150
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.519
is that okay. So, F you can rewrite. So, suppose I want to rewrite F I will write it like this

151
00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:57.319
okay. So, F you can write it as F cos theta i cap F cos theta i cap what is this F just

152
00:17:57.319 --> 00:18:03.919
the magnitude it is just the size okay F cos theta i cap makes it with direction plus

153
00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:12.879
F sin theta j cap. Now that means I need to remember cos theta sin theta various values

154
00:18:12.879 --> 00:18:18.279
for it I will given you a list here you know this already most of you probably know for

155
00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:26.480
angle 0, 30, 45, 60 and 90 you know sin 0 is 0 sin 30 is half okay sin 45 is 1 by root

156
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:32.079
2 sin 60 is root 3 by 2 and sin 90 is 1 okay. Now if you do not remember you should definitely

157
00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:34.960
memorize this because this is going to come up everywhere.

158
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:46.000
Two important extra information sin 37 is almost 3 by 5 okay. So, now if you look at

159
00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:54.400
this triangle 3, 4, 5 you remember this triangle right. Now if you take this triangle this

160
00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:01.920
angle is almost 37 degrees exactly you should look at it it will be some 36.9 something

161
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.960
slightly less than 37 but we will call it 37 degrees many questions we will say angle

162
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:17.360
is 37 sin 37 3 by 5 cos 37 4 by 5 and then if you look at this angle this angle is 53

163
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:28.200
degrees. So, sin 53 4 by 5 cos 53 3 by 5 just remember this is a very important value to

164
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.440
just keep in mind. So, many questions we will say 37 degrees advantages sin 37 3 by 5 rational

165
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:41.480
number integers again there 4 by 5 integers whereas if you take sin 60 root 3 is difficult

166
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.640
to play with cos 60 is very nice but sin 60 is not okay.

167
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:55.200
Let us take an example. So, for example suppose I had 20 Newton force making an angle of 60

168
00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:03.680
degrees write this force as a vector. So, if I write this force as a vector how much is

169
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:16.799
this 20 cos 60. So, 20 cos 60 look at cos 60 cos 60 is half which means 10 like this

170
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:30.200
and then what about this 20 sin 60 sin 60 is root 3 by 2. So, 10 root 3 therefore if

171
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:49.559
I call this force F what is F 10 i cap plus 10 root 3 j cap Newton's why is this useful

172
00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:54.480
because if I now have a question where there is one force like this one force like this

173
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.799
one force like this and I want to add you will see that this becomes extremely useful

174
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:06.559
okay. Now, if this was not 60 but it was 53 degrees then I will use sin 53 4 by 5 okay.

175
00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:13.639
So, cos 53 4 for first for this one 3 by 5 and sin 63 for that which is 4 by 5 okay.

176
00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:16.879
You will see that there would not be a root 3 there will just be a 4 by 5 which makes

177
00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:21.119
it easy for calculation okay. Otherwise you should know what to do with that root 3 as

178
00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:26.359
well. So, let us do one question where we have multiple forces and we want to find the

179
00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.560
acceleration. So, now let us look at this question. So, in this question there is a

180
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:37.880
4 kg block in space assume this whole thing is in space what is the difference if it was

181
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.040
not in space then I am going to have to worry about gravitational force which I am not drawing

182
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:48.120
here okay. So, it is in space now there is one force which is minus 3 i plus 7 j Newton

183
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.760
then there is one which is 4 Newton upward you can always add the j and say this is 4

184
00:21:53.759 --> 00:22:01.279
j cap Newtons okay. Why is this minus because it is this way minus 3 i cap plus 7 because

185
00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:07.160
it is upward. So, this way this way now that force I do not know in the i j form okay but

186
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:14.119
I know it is 10 Newton magnitude at an angle of 30 degrees and then there is a 3 i cap

187
00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:20.440
because it is a horizontal force. What is the acceleration of the 4 kg block? So, that

188
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.759
is the question how will we go about it we will need to find the net force and then divide

189
00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:35.759
by the mass. So, net force by mass what is the mass 4 kg. So, this is easy what is the

190
00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:41.720
problem net force that is the problem. So, if I want this acceleration I need to find

191
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:47.680
net force this is easy to add this is easy to add this is easy to add what is the problem

192
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.360
that fellow is the problem why because it is some weird angle what do I do I will rewrite

193
00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:01.519
this in the form of i and j how much i 10 cos 30 10.

194
00:23:01.519 --> 00:23:09.720
So, let us write here 10 cos 30 what is cos 30 I will write cos 30 but you should be able

195
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:16.600
to calculate cos 30 is equal to root 3 by 2 you can see there it is root 3 by 2 now what

196
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.920
happens if you forget bad luck you need to remember these values ok this is going to

197
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:28.080
come up 100 times well 1000 times you will find this everywhere you should memorize this

198
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.040
entire set and you should not take time to come up with it you say cos 30 tau all root

199
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:46.160
3 by 2. So, 10 times root 3 by 2 10 root 3 by 2 is how much 5 root 3 Newtons ok, but

200
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:55.600
then there is also this component how much is this component 10 cos 30 10 sin 30. So,

201
00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:02.680
10 sin 30 is how much half this is cos 30 that is automatically sin 30 ok. So, how much

202
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:11.960
is this 10 into half is 5 Newtons. So, this force you can rewrite this force as 5 root

203
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:20.519
3 i cap plus because it is pointing up if this force was pointing down it will be minus

204
00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:29.840
5 j cap, but this is going up. So, therefore, it is plus 5 j cap Newtons now can you add

205
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.960
up all the vectors you can write. So, let us quickly add minus 3 i cap my. So, let me

206
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:44.319
do all this minus 3 i cap I do not need to add this do I need to add that yes plus 3

207
00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:59.759
i cap. So, this is done this is done plus 5 root 3 i cap this is also done now j cap

208
00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:05.839
what is the j cap. So, plus so let me actually write the j cap down here ok. So, plus so

209
00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:21.359
much j cap what j cap 7 j cap 4 j cap anything else done done done done done right this part

210
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:31.800
but that is not yet done. So, plus 5 j cap divided by 4 k g this many Newtons by so

211
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:39.320
many k g's this is going to give me meters per second square si units. Acceleration of

212
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:48.720
the 4 k g block vector vector acceleration minus 3 plus 3 cancels 5 root 3 divided by

213
00:25:48.720 --> 00:26:02.319
4. So, 5 root 3 by 4 i cap and what is this 5 plus 7 7 plus 5 12 12 plus 4 16 16 divided

214
00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:13.000
by 4 4. So, 4 j cap meters per second square this is the vector but suppose they ask you

215
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.079
look at the direction this is something i cap something j cap it is going in that direction

216
00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:22.240
this is a messy question but you got an easy answer suppose somebody says no I do not want

217
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:30.599
this I want a magnitude which means we write it like this just a no arrow on top.

218
00:26:30.599 --> 00:26:39.039
What is the answer root of this square plus that square what is this square 5 square will

219
00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:49.440
be 25 4 square 16 root of 3 whole square will basically give me 3 plus 4 square which is

220
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:56.000
16 you can take this there simplify 75 plus 15 16 is going to be something right 256 you

221
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.240
can add it then you can take the square root but you will get some number weird number and

222
00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.559
that is the answer. So, much meters per second square obviously you need to simplify I am

223
00:27:05.599 --> 00:27:10.480
not doing that. So, is that clear to everybody you understood how to solve this problem because

224
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.079
what is important here is that you resolve this force.

225
00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:20.200
Now, this was given in i and j suppose this was also given with an angle you will resolve

226
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.679
suppose instead of giving you this angle or this angle this angle was given then you will

227
00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:33.759
say this force cos will be that because this angle can also be theta then you will say

228
00:27:33.879 --> 00:27:40.680
f cos theta will be that component f sin theta will be this component you have to be bit

229
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.960
careful then cos theta j cap sin theta will give you minus i cap because it is pointing

230
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.759
in that direction luckily we do not have this in this question but we may have now unfortunately

231
00:27:51.759 --> 00:27:58.720
all the questions we were doing are all in space I did not have to count gravity I did

232
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.519
not have to worry about a floor now sometimes all of that will matter.

233
00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:08.599
So, let us take a couple of questions where you have forces acting at angles but you have

234
00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:13.960
it with on the surface of the earth that means there is imagine a big box I place it on a

235
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:20.759
table and I am pulling like this my force is at an angle but the block is probably going

236
00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:25.039
to move horizontally it may also move up but it may move horizontally. So, let us look

237
00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:26.039
at a question like that.
